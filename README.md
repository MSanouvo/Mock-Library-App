# Mock-Library-App

A libray app that acts as a bookshelf for the user. (Project Idea provided by The Odin Project)

Upon opening the app, users are able to add book to their bookself by filling out a form and providing the name of the book (author and page count are option parameters). After entering their book, they will see a card pop up on the screen displaying the entered inforamtion. Users can check the box on the card to show whether a book has been read or not and remove a book they don't want on their bookshelf.

Overall, this project wasn't too bad. There were some difficulties getting event listeners to function properly and figuring out where to properly place them or understand what needs to be created dynamically. I spent a lot of time bugfixing the interaction between the dynamically created cards and getting the correct info I needed to work with.

Aside from polishing the code a bit and maybe improving on the look of the page, I would like to later add a backend to the app so data can be saved onto something like JSON. I made something similar to this app a while ago in python serves the same purpose for another hobby of mine, so once I learn more about implementing backend I plan to return to this project and change it track my gunpla backlog rather than books.
